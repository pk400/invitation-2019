            You have been invited to Joel's 26th birthday bash! For my birthday
            I would love to play a session of <img class="dnd-logo" src="dnd.png">
            with all you lovely people. As you are all probably well aware, I play
            D&D and have been playing for about two years now, and have been a 
            Dungeon Master for a most of those sessions. It holds a special place
            in my heart, because it is the union of my love for gaming,
            storytelling, roleplaying, and being surrounded by amazing people. So
            naturally, I decided to play a session on my birthday. Below, I have 
            some details about the game if you are interested. But first, some
            information about the session:

            The world of D&D exists in the theatre of the mind. What does that
            mean? It means to use the side of the brain that has been dormant
            for the last decade. Just kidding.
          </p>
          <p>
            A quick high level overview of the game.
            There are two types of players: the DM (Dungeon Master), and just
            regular players. The DM's are in charge of narrating the story, 
            telling you what is currently happening in the world and to enforce
            a specific set of rules (like a referee), and it is up to you
            (the player) to decide what you want to do. But you must be
            wondering... Okay, so what <em>can</em> I do? In terms of
            interacting with the world, you can do <em><b>anything</b></em>!
            You simply tell the DM what you want to do, roll some dice, and they will tell you
            how your character does it. A PDF containing the Basic Rules can
            be found <a href="https://media.wizards.com/2018/dnd/downloads/DnD_BasicRules_2018.pdf">here</a>.
            Feel free to ask your DM for any questions you may have!

      <h2>Tell me more!</h2>
      <p>
        Uh.. Okay..So each player gets to choose (pre-generated or player-created)
        a character that they wish to play as. This character is such a large
        part of the game that it is often overlooked for newcomers to the game.
        If you could be anyone other than yourself who would you be (within the
        context of the realm of course).
      </p>
      <p>
        Where did your character grow up,
        what are their personality quirks, what is that weird thing they like
        to do, are they impulsive, are they cunning, do they have a silver tongue,
        are they seeking fame, are they willing to sacrifice themselves for the 
        sake of others, are they from a noble family, or are they born with no
        last name? These are some questions to ask yourself when thinking of a 
        character. The best way to imagine it is, is to create a character that
        you would love to see in Lord of the Rings or any similar movie.
      </p>
      <p>
        I will of course provide pre-generated characters for those who are looking
        for a more casual experience. But even with a pre-generated character
        feel free to be as creative as you would like.

      <h2>Home Rules</h2>
      <p>
        More detailed rules will be explained on the day of the event, but I hope
        the summary above is enough to get you excited to play (I got excited 
        typing this lol)! Below are some home rules that I would like us to
        abide by when playing (so things don't get too out of hand):
        <ol>
          <li>Don't try killing other players.</li>
          <li>We will be following a module, so let's try to stay on track of
            the main storyline.
          </li>
          <li>ROLEPLAY! (This makes it more fun for me too)</li>
          <li>But don't try seducing the character the DM is playing. (Just..no)</li>
          <li>Be a team player. Solve problems together and let others have a chance in the spotlight.</li>
          <li>DON'T SPLIT THE PARTY.</li>
          <li>Lots of rules will be very loose, so no pro-gamers allowed.</li>
          <li>No meta-gaming. (Don't look up the module ahead of time)</li>
          <li>Be kind to your fellow gamer.</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <h2>That's about it!</h2>
      <p>
        The last and most important rule would be to <em>Have fun, and enjoy
        the adventure.</em> We are getting too old to be bitter about the little
        things in life (I'm turning 26 dammit). Let's enjoy the time spent with
        the other people in our lives and share one of the greatest stories
        ever told.
